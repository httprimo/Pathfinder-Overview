# Architecture Diagrams Folder

Place your architecture diagrams in this folder:

1. `system-architecture-diagram.png` (or `.jpg`, `.svg`) - System Architecture Diagram
2. `erd-diagram.png` (or `.jpg`, `.svg`) - Entity Relationship Diagram

## Image Requirements:
- Recommended formats: PNG, JPG, SVG, or WebP
- For best quality, use PNG or SVG
- Ensure diagrams are clear and readable
- Recommended minimum width: 1200px for good display quality

The Architecture.vue component will automatically display these images when they are placed in this folder.
